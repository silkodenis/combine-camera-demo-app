An iOS application that demonstrates the usage of the **[CombineCamera](https://github.com/silkodenis/swift-combine-camera)** Swift package for video capturing in an application with a UDF (Unidirectional Data Flow) architecture using Combine.

## Description

This demo application showcases how to integrate and utilize the **[CombineCamera](https://github.com/silkodenis/swift-combine-camera)** Swift package to capture video on iOS devices.
